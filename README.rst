============
Introduction
============

reStructuredText (one word) is a plain-text markup language for writing
technical documents, books, websites, and more.
It is easy to read and write because it is just regular text and all you
need is a simple text editor. Even Notepad would suffice.
Despite it being written in plain-text, it is powerful enough
to create professional technical documentation, books, and websites.

There are software tools that will convert your plain-text document
in to the desired output format. For example: HTML, PDF, ePub, or custom.
It is capable of auto-generating table-of-contents, hyperlinks between
documents, creating headings, tables, and many other elements.
It is also extendable and customizable.

In this tutorial, we will walk through everything you need to know to
excel with reStructuredText. We will start with th e basics, but
if you follow through to the end, you will have a deep
understanding of how it works and how to extend the source code to suit
your own needs.

The Python community were the first adopters since it's design
specification was written as a Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) by
David Goodger in 2001.

PEP-257: Docstring Conventions
PEP-258: Docutils Design Specification
http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/peps/pep-0257.html
http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/peps/pep-0258.html

Do not be misled in to believing reStructuredText is only good for Python
documentation. Python does use reStructuredText
as the standard documentation, but it can be used for any kind of
documentation and even writing books and making HTML pages. 
GitHub supports reStructuredText and will automatically process a
README.rst and provide the HTML output if someone lands on your project.

This is aimed at technical writers, programmers, and authors who want
an easy yet powerful way to write documents and books.
If you are already familiar with Markdown, reStructuredText should come
naturally. It is just as easy to get started with, but has many more
powerful features available. If you are currently using Markdown,
I highly recommend you give reStructuredText a chance.
The learning curve is small if you already know very basic Markdown
syntax.

============================
Create a basic .rst document
============================

Before getting in to all of the features, let's look at a very basic
reStructuredText file. reStructuredText files typically have ``.rst`` or ``.txt`` extensions.
Here is a simple document::

  =================
  My Project Readme
  =================
  -------------------------
  Clever subtitle goes here
  -------------------------

  Introduction
  ============

  This is an example reStructuredText document that starts at the very top
  with a title and a sub-title. There is one primary header, Introduction.
  There is one example subheading below.
  The document is just plain text so it is easily readable even before
  being converted to HTML, man page, PDF or other formats.

  Subheading
  ----------

  The basic syntax is not that different from Markdown, but it also
  has many more powerful features that Markdown doesn't have. We aren't
  taking advantage of those yet though.

  - Bullet points
  - Are intuitive
  - And simple too

That's a basic reStructuredText document. We haven't looked at any of the more
powerful features like hyperlinking or adding images yet. You can save this
file as ``README.rst`` or whatever you want and then store it. If you
are familiar with Markdown syntax, you'll notice it's not very different.
GitHub also supports ``.rst`` files so if you include a ``README.rst``,
GitHub will convert it to HTML when people land on the repository.

=====
Tools
=====

There are two primary tools for converting reStructuredText in to finished
products. First, there is ``docutils`` which is contains the core parser and
writer tools. Then there is ``Sphinx`` which is built on top of docutils and
intended for larger projects. Sphinx adds even more functionality and can be
used to create very professional looking documents.

--------
docutils
--------

`docutils <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/>`_ is a Python package that contains
classes and scripts that can parse, format, and output to various formats like HTML.


Install docutils
----------------

Install the Python **docutils** package in the terminal using ``pip`` with::

  python -m pip install docutils

Convert RST documents
---------------------

There are several tools that come with the package, but some primary
ones are::

  rst2html4
  rst2html5
  rst2man
  rst2xml
  rst2latex

These tools will output to stdout that can be piped to a file like this::

  rst2html5 mydoc.rst > mydoc.html

You can create custom functions called directives to enhance your markup.
You can also create custom writers to output the parsed document in different
ways.

------
Sphinx
------

`Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_ is built on top of
``docutils``. While tools like ``rst2html5`` that come with ``docutils`` will
turn a ``.rst`` file in to a ``.html``, it is generally good for a single page.
Sphinx is good for larger documentation or writing projects. You can have
multiple ``.rst`` files in your project to organize and link between them.
Sphinx is much more powerful and can be used to publish books and websites
using reStructuredText.

Sphinx has a few output options. Among the options are building a website of
multiple HTML documents that link together. When you view documentation on
https://readthedocs.org or you read the official Python documentation, those
are Sphinx generated pages. You can also build it as a single-
page HTML document. It also offers plain-text, PDF, epub, and LaTeX builders.

Sphinx also adds a few custom directives (the ``..`` prefixed functions) like
the ``toctree`` which allows you to embed the table of contents and link to
another document.

If you are going for "serious" documentation, Sphinx is the choice.

Install Sphinx
--------------

Sphinx is a Python package build on top of ``docutils`` and can be installed
with ``pip`` like this::

  python -m pip install sphinx

Start a new project
-------------------

Once sphinx is installed, you don't generally invoke ``sphinx-build`` directly
to build a project the way you call something like ``rst2html``. Instead, you
call ``sphinx-quickstart`` which will generate a new project with its own build
script. For example, this command will create a new directory called ``docs``
and put the project inside of it::

  sphinx-quickstart docs

It will prompt you for a project name and an author name, as well as many other
questions. You can select all of the defaults if you are unsure.

The new project will have an ``index.rst`` for you to start editing, as well as
a ``Makefile`` and a ``make.bat`` so you can build it on Windows. It will also
have a directory for templates and building if you want to customize the
output. You can add custom CSS and HTML.

Edit the ``index.rst`` and add other pages and subdirectories as needed. When
you are done editing, you can make/build the project with the ``make`` command.

Build the project
-----------------

Once you are ready to build the reStructuredText documents in to their final
form, you call ``make``::

  make  # Will print all options
  make.bat # In Windows, sphinx-quickstart creates a make.bat in project root

  # Build the documents to various formats
  make html
  make singlehtml
  make epub
  make man
  make latex
  make text

  # Python specific (not covered here)
  make doctest   # Run unit tests embedded in docstrings
  make coverage  # Check documentation coverage of code

They will end up in the ``_build`` directory.

------
Pandoc
------

`Pandoc <https://pandoc.org/>`_ is a universal document converter. It can take
sources in reStructuredText, Markdown, LaTeX, Microsoft Word docx, Open
Document odt, HTML, epub, and many others and convert it in to various output
formats including HTML, docx, odt, ppt, epub, PDF, or other markup formats like
Markdown, RST, AsciiDoc.

Pandoc is intended to be a uinversal may behave slightly differently from
dedicated RST tools like ``docutils`` and ``Sphinx`` which 
uses ``docutils``. I would only recommend using Pandoc if you have special
requirements to convert to a format that is not suported by ``docutils`` and
``sphinx``.

Install pandoc
--------------

Full installation instructions at
`Pandoc.org <https://pandoc.org/installing.html>`_

Releases for Windows, Mac, Linux are available for download on GitHub at
https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases.

- **Windows**: Download the installer from the pandoc releases page.
- **Mac**: Use brew to install: ``brew install pandoc``
- **Linux**: Download the linux.tar.gz file and extract it. The ``bin/``
  directory contains the ``pandoc`` executable. Alternatively, in Debian based
  distributions, there is a ``.deb`` package available for download on that
  GitHub releases page.

---------------
Readthedocs.org
---------------

The website https://readthedocs.org/ is a great website that will build and host
your documentation for you. You can use Sphinx, Mkdcocs, or generate your own
documents. I recommend using Sphinx. When you use ``sphinx-quickstart`` to 
generate a ``docs/`` directory in your project, ReadTheDocs.org will know what to do.
Sign up and tell ReadTheDocs.org about your repository, and set up a webhook
to automatically build and host your documentation any time there is a git push.

They will host multiple versions of documentation, you can use their theme
or custom themes, and it even makes PDF and ePub versions available.


===============
Syntax examples
===============

This is a mashup of common syntax. It's like a cheatsheet for quick reference.
There is some freedom with reStructuredText that allows you to pick different
characters for creating headers and bulleted lists. As long as you are consistent
throughout your document it will interpret the headers automatically. This
example uses my preferred characters and styling for headings.

Overline and underline combined is separate from just underline. The lines can
be created with any of the following characters, based on preference. You just
need to be consistent within a single document,
``' " . , : ; ! ? - ) ] } / \ >``.

Try saving the contents of this example to ``sample.rst`` and build it to HTML
to see how it looks yourself with::

  rst2html5 sample.rst > sample.html

Some of the elements covered in this example are:

- Headings
- Comments
- Images
- Lists
- Preformatted text
- Code blocks
- Links
- Footnotes
- Transitions/lines/horizontal rules
- Tables
- Preserving line breaks

Here is the sample reStructuredText::

  """""""""""""""""
  Document Title
  """""""""""""""""
  ...........
  Subtitle
  ...........

  .. contents:: Overview
     :depth: 3

  ===================
  Section 1
  ===================

  Text can be *italicized* or **bolded**  as well as ``monospaced``.
  You can \*escape certain\* special characters.

  ----------------------
  Subsection 1 (Level 2)
  ----------------------

  Some section 2 text

  Sub-subsection 1 (level 3)
  --------------------------

  Some more text.

  =========
  Examples
  =========

  --------
  Comments
  --------

  .. This is a comment
     Special notes that are not shown but might come out as HTML comments

  ------
  Images
  ------

  Add an image with:

  .. image:: screenshots/file.png
     :height: 100
     :width: 200
     :alt: alternate text

  You can inline an image or other directive with the |customsub| command.

  .. |customsub| image:: image/image.png
                :alt: (missing image text)

  -----
  Lists
  -----

  - Bullet are made like this
  - Point levels must be consistent
      * Sub-bullets
          + Sub-sub-bullets
  - Lists

  Term
      Definition for term
  Term2
      Definition for term 2

  :List of Things: 
      item1 - these are 'field lists' not bulleted lists
      item2
      item 3

  :Something: single item
  :Someitem: single item

  -----------------
  Preformatted text
  -----------------

  A code example prefix must always end with double colon like it's presenting something::

      Anything indented is part of the preformatted block
     Until
    It gets back to
   Allll the way left

  Now we're out of the preformatted block.

  ------------
  Code blocks
  ------------

  There are three equivalents: ``code``, ``sourcecode``, and ``code-block``.

  .. code:: python

     import os
     print(help(os))

  .. sourcecode::

    # Equivalent

  .. code-block::

    # Equivalent

  -----
  Links
  -----

  Web addresses by themselves will auto link, like this: https://www.devdungeon.com

  You can also inline custom links: `Google search engine <https://www.google.com>`_

  This is a simple link_ to Google with the link defined separately.

  .. _link: https://www.google.com

  This is a link to the `Python website`_.

  .. _Python website: http://www.python.org/

  This is a link back to `Section 1`_. You can link based off of the heading name
  within a document.

  ---------
  Footnotes
  ---------

  Footnote Reference [1]_

  .. [1] This is footnote number one that would go at the bottom of the document.

  Or autonumbered [#]

  .. [#] This automatically becomes second, based on the 1 already existing.

  -----------------
  Lines/Transitions
  -----------------

  Any 4+ repeated characters with blank lines surrounding it becomes an hr line, like this.

  ====================================

  ------
  Tables
  ------

  +--------+--------+--------+
  | Time   | Number | Value  |
  +========+========+========+
  | 12:00  | 42     | 2      |
  +--------+--------+--------+
  | 23:00  | 23     | 4      |
  +--------+--------+--------+

  ----------------------
  Preserving line breaks
  ----------------------

  Normally you can break the line in the middle of a paragraph and it will
  ignore the newline. If you want to preserve the newlines, use the ``|`` prefix
  on the lines. For example:

  | These lines will
  | break exactly
  | where we told them to.

============================================
Splitting up a document in to multiple files
============================================

Sphinx has a special directive for building linking pages together
and embedding a table of contents from another page. The ``toctree``
directive will essentially import the headings/table of contents
from the file specified. It is good for creating a master landing
page that links to sub-documents. Here is an example of its usage snipped
from the Python official documentation at
https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/master/Doc::

  .. toctree::

     whatsnew/index.rst
     tutorial/index.rst
     faq/index.rst
     glossary.rst

     about.rst
     bugs.rst
     copyright.rst
     license.rst

And inside each one of those directories/.rst files, you can put more
``toctree`` elements if you have nested levels of complexity.

======================
Create a custom writer
======================

The ``docutils`` package comes with several writers, including html4,
html5, and odf. If you aren't satisfied with the existing output formats, you
can create a custom
``Writer``. You can subclass the existing writers if you want to extend or
modify them. We will look at how to extend the
``docutils.writers.html5_polyglot.Writer`` class to override different methods
and modify the output.

We'll make a custom writer that outputs slightly modified HTML
and we will print out just the body with no HTML boilerplate.
The goal is to
generate HTML that can be inserted in to a content management system
like Drupal where it is assumed the outer HTML template and CSS styling is
already available and all you need is the content section.

------------
Base classes
------------

``docutils`` provides the base classes and tools needed. We will need to get
more familiar with the writer and translator classes. They are intimately
tied together and we will be creating subclasses of both.

I found a great tutorial on this topic at
http://www.arnebrodowski.de/blog/write-your-own-restructuredtext-writer.html
that covers this topic. I recommend giving it a read.

After inspecting the source code for ``docutils``, this is how the class
structure is set up for the html writer and translator.

Writer class heirarchy for the HTML writers:

- ``docutils.writers.Writer``
    + ``docutils.writers._html_base.Writer``
        * ``docutils.writers.html5_polyglot.Writer``
        * ``docutils.writers.html4css1.Writer``

Translator class heirarchy for HTML translators:

- ``docutils.nodes.NodeVisitor``
    + ``docutils.nodes.GenericNodeVisitor``
    + ``docutils.writers._html_base.HTMLTranslator``
        * ``docutils.writers.html5_polyglot.HTMLTranslator``
        * ``docutils.writers.html4css1.HTMLTranslator``







.. ---

.. Things this custom writer should do:
.. - Reduce headings one level, so the top level sections are h2's
.. - Eliminate the Title and subtitle output (or output it as html comment)
.. - Eliminate all the HTML boilerplate, stylesheets, and JS includes
.. - don't add any extra classes/ids that aren't needed
.. - for code blocks, wrap in pre+code
.. - collect links and create a ReferenceLinks section? (a directive??)
.. - links should open in _blank target, unless they are relative links within the same domain


.. ---


You need to define a custom Writer and Translator. The translator defines the
logic used by the writer on how to output/wrap each node.
You can subclass an existing writer. These are
some of the existing writer and translator classes related to HTML output.



Note that this is only a few of the writer classes, there are several other
subclasses in the ``docutils.writers`` package, but these are the ones
we're interested in since we're looking for custom HTML output. You can
subclass any one of these, depending on how much logic you want to inherit.
We should choose wether to subclass the lowest level class like
``docutils.writers.Writer`` or the highest level one available in the
``html5_polyglot`` module, ``docutils.writers.html5_polyglot.Writer``.



--------------------------
Minimal custom HTML writer
--------------------------

Here is a minimal example of how to create and use your own writer. In this
case, we are simply inheriting the behavior of the ``html5_polyglot`` writer
and translator that come with ``docutils`` package. We aren't modifying
any of the behavior yet, but it's a good starting place.

Custom writer example::

  """Minimal writer/translator for customizing docutils output"""
  from docutils.writers import html5_polyglot
  from docutils.core import publish_string

  class MyCustomHTMLTranslator(html5_polyglot.HTMLTranslator):
      pass

  class MyCustomHTMLWriter(html5_polyglot.Writer):
      def __init__(self ):
          html5_polyglot.Writer.__init__(self)
          self.translator_class = MyCustomHTMLTranslator

  if __name__ == '__main__':
      html_output = publish_string(source='Put reStructured text here.',
                                   writer=MyCustomHTMLWriter())
      print(html_output)

That example will run and output HTML. Now you are free to modify the behavior
of the writer or the translator. To see how they work under the hood, look in
to the source code of its parent class, and the parent of that class too.
Find what functions you want to override and implement them in your class.


-----------------------
Full custom HTML writer
-----------------------


Since we want to lower the heading level by one, we should replace the method
that is in charge or outputting those header tags. I found it in
``docutils.writers._html_base.HTMLTranslator.visit_title()`` so I implemented
a ``visit_title()`` method in my own translator by copy and pasting the original
one as a starting place. Here is the full code used.

Custom HTML writer example::

  """
  A custom docutils writer that will convert reStructuredText (RST) to html5,
  but slightly modified from the html5_polyglot writer. The goal is to output
  only the HTML body with the intention of embedding it inside a larger HTML
  document using a content management system (CMS) like Drupal, Wordpress,
  or Django.

  - It only outputs the body, from subtitle to end of document, no HTML
    boilerplate, no CSS, no title.
  - It lowers the heading level by one. It assumes the h1 is being output
    as the document title by the CMS. The output starts with the subtitle,
    and goes to the end of the document.

  Built using
  http://www.arnebrodowski.de/blog/write-your-own-restructuredtext-writer.html
  as a reference.

  It has a translator and a writer.

  The translator is a  defines how to wrap or output each type of node.
  At it's core, the translator is actually a ``nodes.GenericNodeVisitor``
  that visits each node and decides how to process it.

  The writer is what gets passed to the ``publish_*`` functions in the end
  that process the document and provide HTML output.
  The writer contains a reference to which translator it will use.

  To use this writer, see the __main__ section at the bottom.
  You call ``docutils.core.publish_*`` and pass it your customer writer.

The code above defines two classes and then provides a ``__main__`` example
of how to use it. The ``Writer`` class is very simple, and it just specifies
which translator to use. The bulk of the logic lives in the translator class.


=========================
Create a custom directive
=========================

Directives are the special lines that start with two dots and are treated
as special functions. Some examples we've already see are the table of contents
``.. contents::`` and images ``.. image::``. Under the hood, they really are
just calling Python functions. You can create your own custom directives
to execute special logic or output dynamic content.

There are several ways you can call a directive, depending on how much
input you need to provide to the directive. Here are some different examples::

  .. mydirective::

  .. mydirective2:: Argument1

  .. mydirective3:: Somevalue1
     :param1: somevalue2
     :param2: somevalue3

  .. mydirective4::

    This is part of directive4.
    All of this will get passed to directive4.
    Until the indentation returns all the way to the left.

  Now we're out of the directive body.

Read all about the built-in reStructuredText directives at
http://docutils.sourceforge.net/0.14/docs/ref/rst/directives.html


What if we made a::

  .. beware:: dogs
  .. image_carousel::
  .. slideshow::


Start by looking at base directives
Minimal example - extending an existing/base directive or
full example - actually do something


Use an example
Pygments is a Python package for highlighting source code.
There is a ``..code::`` directive that uses Pygment.

In the Pygment source code repository it is in ``external/rst-directive.py``.
We can use that as a good example.

https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/pygments-main/src/7941677dc77d4f2bf0bbd6140ade85a9454b8b80/external/rst-directive.py?at=default&fileviewer=file-view-default

------------
Base class
------------

Built-in directives can be found in the ``docutils.parsers.rst.directives``
package.
In there, you will find all of the functions to register directives, call
directives, and all of the directive classes like the ``Image`` class that
corresponds with the ``..image::`` directive.

All reStructuredText directives inherit from the base class
``docutils.parsers.rst.Directive`` which is defined in
``docutils.parsers.rst.__init__``.

..code:: python

  # Defined in docutils.parsers.rst.__init__.py
  class Directive(object):

The docstring on this class is actually quite thorough you can access it
easily using pydoc from the command line::

  python -m pydoc docutils.parsers.rst.Directive

Or from the interactive python interpreter::

  >>> import docutils.parsers.rst
  >>> help(docutils.parsers.rst.Directive)

Refer to those sources for a full list of options. We'll look at a simple
example to get you started.

Custom directive::

  from docutils import nodes
  from docutils.parsers.rst import directives, Directive


  class MyCustomDirective(Directive):
  required_arguments = 1
  optional_arguments = 0
  final_argument_whitespace = True
  option_spec = dict([(key, directives.flag) for key in VARIANTS])
  has_content = True

  def run(self):
      self.assert_has_content()
      self.arguments[0]
      self.options

      if error_condition:
          raise self.error('Error message.')

      # Does format='html' mean it will get ignored in text or odf output?
      # We create a node to return
      return [nodes.raw('', parsed, format='html')]

  directives.register_directive('mydirective', MyCustomDirective)


  if __name__ == '__main__':
  reStructuredText_source = """
  =====================
  Custom directive test
  =====================

  .. mydirective::

  My directive should have run now.
  """

  # Since the directive was registered already, it should get used when
  # the parser runs when it encounters the ``.. mydirective::`` text.
  html_output = publiish_string(source=reStructuredText_source, writer=html5_polyglot.Writer)

  print(html_output)

``docutils.parsers.rst.Directive``

------------------------
Minimal custom directive
------------------------

There are two steps:

- Create a customer directive class that inherits from
  ``docutils.parsers.rst.Directive``
- Register the directive with
  ``docutils.parsers.rst.directives.directives.register_directive()``

Once you have your directive registered, anytime you call one of the
``docutils.core.publish_*`` functions, it will process your directive if
it sees on in the reStructuredText it parses.

Custom directive example::

  class MyCustomDirective(Directive)
    run():
      print('it ran!')
      return(my custom node? a text node? a code bloc node? an image? etc)
      process without outputting anything?

  directives.register('shortcutname', MyCustomDirective)


---------------------
Full custom directive
---------------------

The previous example was a minimal skeleton.
This example will actually do something.



=======================
Sublime Text RST Plugin
=======================

There is a Sublime Text package that helps when writing reStrucutredText. It
helps with navigation, formatting, collapsing blocks, and more.

You can find more information about the plugin at:
https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Restructured%20Text%20%28RST%29%20Snippets

The plugin comes with several features, including:

- Auto over/underline formatting for headers
- Smart bullet lists
- Quick build/preview shortcut
- Section folding
- Jump between headers

------------
Setup plugin
------------

Use the `Sublime Text package manager`_ to install the plugin. Install that
first if you do not already have it.

.. _Sublime Text package manager: https://packagecontrol.io/

Then, to install the package, in Sublime Text:

- Press ``Ctrl-Shift-P``
- Search for ``RST Snippets``
- Highlight the plugin in the search results and press enter to install.

--------------
Use the plugin
--------------

There are several features in the plugin but I will cover a few basics.
See full documentation at https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Restructured%20Text%20%28RST%29%20Snippets
for full details.

- When writing headers, just over/underline it with 3 characters and then press
  tab and it will auto complete the underlines to match the length of the title.
- When making a bullet list, press enter and it will automatically add the next
  bullet point on the next line. You can also press tab to indent one more level
  and it will swap out the bullet character to match the next level.
- Quick build/preview shortcut - Press ``Ctrl-Shift-R`` to build and preview
  the document.
- Folding and unfolding - Press ``Shift-Tab`` while the cursor is on a heading
- Jump between headers with ``Alt-Up/Down``
